# What is Mainframe
Mainframes are computers. They are known by your huge capacity, high performance, large amounts of memory and processors.  Mainframe computer can handle many tasks concurrently and they are critical to commercial databases, transaction servers, and applications that require high resiliency, security, and agility.
For that reason these computers are robust, rugged, reliable, secured, and available for nonstop **24×7** operations.
Behind the complexity of this huge computer it is closer to you than what you would imagine. You might never heard about the mainframe, however it is with you since you wake up in the morning. 

# Who Uses the Mainframe and why? 
You might not know mainframe, however it is part of your daily routine. You are not a direct user of Mainframe, but you definetly are a end user of most of the financial, enterprise, retail and data management transactions we interact during your day. All types and sizes of business and organization can leverage the Mainframe as technology to support your business. The most common are:
1. Big organization to manage enterprise-wide mission-critical ERP operations, 
2. Banks to handle to trillion of transactions, 
3. Back end operations of many digital applications.

# Mainframe Basic Architecture & Components

## Mainframe Key Components
Mainframe In the past, the term Mainframe was synonymous with the hardware (S360/370/390 chips) and software (MVS, VM, VSE).  However, nowadays, term mainframe now has a more complex meaning.
 The term Mainframe must be divided into two meanings.  (1) the hardware (Z-Series chip) and (2) the operating systems supported by the Z-Series chip (Z/VM, Z/OS, Z/VSE, Linux).
 
### Mainframe Hardware
 
 Z-Series CPU chips:  Supports Z/VM, Z/OS, Z/VSE, Linux operating systems, and open source software.  Also supports Hybrid Cloud technology.  Mainframe hardware includes outboard I/O and encryption CPUs, Hyper Channels, redundant power supplies, and resilience. 
 
### Mainframe Software

Z-Series software: this software is what is traditionally referred to as VM, z/VM, MVS, MVS/XA, MVS/ESA, z/OS, VSE or z/VSE.  These operating systems have evolved and used over the last 50 years.  Mainframe software has evolved from a purely batch oriented system using only JCL to incorporating real time interfaces and Unix System Service.  Mainframe software has progressed to being compatible to distributed systems, the most notable innovating being ZOWE.
 
## Virtual Tour on a Mainframe
We would invite you to do an online tour inside the Mainframe Hardware.  In this Virtual tour you can reach the mainframe machine, open doors, remove switches and understand how Mainframe Hardware looks like today. Click [here](http://m.kaon.com/c/ib), then choose the **"Run Online/Web"** Option, after we recommend to start from the **"System/Server"**, IBM Z is the Mainframe. Then you just need to click on the latest machine type, which will be on the top of the list, once you join in the machine you might find "Explore Product Animation" where you can navigate thru all the machine details. 

# Mainframe brief History and Timeline
Mainframe mission from the 50's until 21st century and it's future. [Learn more about Mainframe history](https://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/mainframe-computers/7/166)

# Mainframe versus Servers 
If you never hear about mainframe, a good starting point is to compare with the most common Servers for us as end users. The Comparison table to bridge the the existing knowledge with the Mainframe concepts and capacity can be found [here](https://www.educba.com/mainframe-vs-server/)

# How Mainframe is evolving thru the decades 
As you saw in the brief history and timeline topic, Mainframe is around since 1950s, that's why, if you had already heard about Mainframe it may sounds like something old. Others might never heard about Mainframe.
Mainframe is a growth area, since it's beginning with the contribution to the NASA studies, until today supporting most of our daily transactions
